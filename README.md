COLOR GAME GENERATOR

This project is built to entertain and also to learn RGB color to build astonishing website. I personally think it's essential for any front-end developer to understand the language of color and color theory as a whole in order to positively influence the user interactiveness with the product through the power of color.

it's of no doubt that developer can influence the behavior of its user. For instance If the design is targeted to kids of age 8 - 15, it'll be easier for developer to easily decide color that please the user. The age bracket tend to like bright colors like lemon yellow, lemon green, pink, light blue, lilac and the likes.

so, practice and get good at it. Thank you
